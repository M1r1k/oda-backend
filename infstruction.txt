After fixing these issues, re-check Symfony requirements executing this command:

   php oda-setup/app/check.php

 Then, you can:

    * Change your current directory to /Users/m1r1k/projects/oda/oda-setup

    * Configure your application in app/config/parameters.yml file.

    * Run your application:
        1. Execute the php app/console server:run command.
        2. Browse to the http://localhost:8000 URL.

    * Read the documentation at http://symfony.com/doc
